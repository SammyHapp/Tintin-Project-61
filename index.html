		<h1> About </h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>My favourite character is Tintin because he has a cute dog,looks smart and is very intelligent. Tintin has a dog named "Snowy". He named it because it's color is of snow. He is a reporter and also a detective. When Tintin finds out something he says "Great Snakes!"and when snowy finds something Tintin says "Good boy Snowy". In the movie it shows that Tintin and Captain Haddock(He is tintin's friend and a captain of a ship. His full name is Archibald Haddock. He likes Whisky a lotðŸ¤¤. His favourite line is "Billions of Blue Blistering Barnacles!!!") met in his ship but in the book, it is written that they met somewhere else. That is where their adventures begin. The captain lives in Marlinspike hall, whereas Tintin and snowy live in their flat. They have been through a lot of adventures like finding treasure, getting stuck on an island and many more. The author of "The adventures of Tintin" was by Herge. The books were officially writen in french but later authors started translating it in English and other languages.</p>
